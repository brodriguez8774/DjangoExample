# Example Django Project

## Description

A very basic Django project, to show how the general framework functions.

Example App 1 will show the bare minimum to have a functioning project.

Example App 2 will show how to redo App 1, but using Django's new generic views.

Example App 3 will show how to implement slightly more advanced usages.
